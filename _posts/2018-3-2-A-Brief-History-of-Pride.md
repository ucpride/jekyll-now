A brief history of the Upper Cumberland PRIDE festival:

Upper Cumberland Pride was founded in August 2011 in Crossville, TN. 

It was the brain child of R.G. Cravens & Beth Thompson. With the help of a group of devoted members of the community they began a journey of establishing an annual Pride Festival. 

Through many months, weeks, days, and hours of planning, our first Pride Festival was held in beautiful Dogwood Park on May 5th, 2012. Since then our festival has been held at the West Side Events Center, and most recently at the Hyder-Burks Pavilion out on Gainsboro Grade. 

Pride is about educating the public on issues facing LGBTQ members in our community. We represent all 16 counties of the Upper Cumberland, and we strive to make our community a better place. Pride is about celebrating who you are, and it's also about educating our young people and also our allies about what it is to be LGBTQ in the Upper Cumberland.
